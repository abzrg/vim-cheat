Query for languages/utilities. It first prompts you to give it a
language/utility; then the second prompt asks you to provide a keyword/pattern
query string. You can omit the second one by just hitting Enter. It will create
a read-only tab and |put|s output of the curl command into that buffer. So, curl
is the only dependency for this plugin.

In the first prompt you can type entire/portion of language/utility and
autocomplete your target by pressing <Tab> key.

If your language/utility is not appeared in the autocomplete, Assign
g:cheat#list to a custom list that contains all the languages/utilities you
might lookup.

As This plugin is not in use all the time, it only loads when a mapping or
command is executed.

To use this plugin you can either:
1. Execute the Ex command >
    :Cheat
2. or, Use a mapping (default: ;i unless this binding is set before) >
    nnoremap ;i :Cheat<CR>
